What is the difference between Carnatic and Hindustani music?

While there are similarities between Carnatic and Hindustani music, there are also several differences that distinguish the two styles. One of the most significant differences is their geographical origin. Carnatic music is primarily associated with the southern states of India, while Hindustani music is associated with the northern and central regions of India.

Another difference between the two styles is the use of instruments. While both styles use similar instruments such as the sitar, veena, and tabla, each style has its own unique instruments and playing techniques. For example, the Carnatic style is known for its use of the violin, mridangam, and ghatam, while the Hindustani style is known for its use of the sarod, tabla, and sitar.

The structure of the music is also different between the two styles. Carnatic music tends to be more structured and formulaic, relying on a fixed pattern of melody and rhythm. Hindustani music, on the other hand, is more improvisational, allowing for greater flexibility and creative expression.
